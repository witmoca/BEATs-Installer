Burning Ember (BEATs) Installer

The installer for [Burning Ember](https://github.com/witmoca/BEATs).
New releases can be found on the [Burning Ember release page](https://github.com/witmoca/BEATs/releases), as opposed to this projects release page.

The installer is an implementation of izpack, a cross platform installer based on java.
Support seems to be focused towards Windows and Linux/*NIX, though it can be used universally.
The only downside associated with installing on less supported systems is a few missing features (desktop shortcuts and the like).

Might need to be made executable before running on some systems.
